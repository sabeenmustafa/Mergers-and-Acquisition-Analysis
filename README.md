# Mergers-and-Acquisition-Analysis

This project delivers a multidimensional data integration pipeline to support strategic M&A decision-making, incorporating audit-based fraud detection, startup success metrics, and ESG risk assessment.

We engineered an end-to-end ETL pipeline using AWS Glue and Lambda, integrating data from PostgreSQL and MySQL into Redshift via S3, enabling scalable processing. The transformed data was queried using Amazon Athena and visualized through Power BI dashboards, providing actionable insights across M&A trends, fraud risk, startup funding, and ESG metrics.

The solution empowers stakeholders with a holistic, data-driven view to drive sustainable and risk-aware M&A outcomes.
